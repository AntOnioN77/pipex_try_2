To e, or not to e, tht is the question:
Whether 'tis noler in the mind to suffer
The slings nd rrows of outrgeous fortune,
Or to tke rms ginst  se of troules
And y opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more; nd y  sleep to sy we end
The hert-he nd the thousnd nturl shoks
Tht flesh is heir to: 'tis  onsummtion
Devoutly to e wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perhne to drem—y, there's the ru:
For in tht sleep of deth wht drems my ome,
When we hve shuffled off this mortl oil,
Must give us puse—there's the respet
Tht mkes lmity of so long life.
For who would er the whips nd sorns of time,
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud mn's ontumely,
The pngs of dispriz'd love, the lw's dely,
The insolene of offie, nd the spurns
Tht ptient merit of th'unworthy tkes,
When he himself might his quietus mke
With  re odkin? Who would frdels er,
To grunt nd swet under  wery life,
But tht the dred of something fter deth,
The undisovere'd ountry, from whose ourn
No trveller returns, puzzles the will,
And mkes us rther er those ills we hve
Thn fly to others tht we know not of?
Thus onsiene doth mke owrds of us ll,
And thus the ntive hue of resolution
Is siklied o'er with the ple st of thought,
And enterprises of gret pith nd moment
With this regrd their urrents turn wry
And lose the nme of tion.
